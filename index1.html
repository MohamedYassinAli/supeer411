      <div id="m-box"><h3> My name is Mohamed Ali, 
        I was born in Somalia and live in Birmingham for almost three years. When I was young, I was deprived of education because of the living conditions. I loved education very much.
  My beginnings in the computer, I learned Windows and the Office program, and I remember the first person who teach  me the computer, is my childhood friend. Then I started working in an Internet caf√© and here was an opportunity for me to learn computer hardwere & softwere,
   and I was trying to fix any computer that broke down.
  I dreamed a lot of becoming a programmer and web devloper, but the study costs were a big problem for me and I could not find anyone to help me, but I did not give up my dream and I hope to achieve my ambition and become a successful programmer
  In conclusion, I would like to thank the Code your Future organization for their assistance, especially to Mrs Claire, because she helped me a lot. I have all my respect and appreciation, and thank you again.

      <!-- <span><b>Thanks</b><p> Hello, <br> -->
    first of all, I would like to thank those who helped me, but I am learning and training to become a website designer. I was happy to find this organization. I do not find the words of thanks, but I promised myself that I would learn and work with all my effort and strive more and more.
    I expect that I will work hard and I have learned a lot and this is some of my work. Thank you
      
      
     A beta site, I hope you like it. This is the first site that I create, and I would be happy to hear your comments and directions.
